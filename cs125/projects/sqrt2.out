(|x| must be less than 1)
You will be asked to enter the value of x and
the number of terms.
Written by Seth Roller

Enter the value of x (|x| < 1): 
Enter the number of terms to use: 

For 3 terms and x is 0.9:

Function     Approx. Value    Actual Value    Difference
sqrt(1+x)    1.348750000000   1.378404875209  -0.029654875209

Enter the value of x (|x| < 1): 

You entered -1.5 you have to enter a number less than 1 and greater than -1.

Try the program again.
