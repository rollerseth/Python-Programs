65: Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent, a

65: new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men

15: are created equal.

60: Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any

60: nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great

62: battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a

65: final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might

52: live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

59: But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot

60: hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have

59: consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will

61: little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what

57: they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the

64: unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It

61: is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us --

66: that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which

63: they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that

58: these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall

61: have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people,

38: for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
