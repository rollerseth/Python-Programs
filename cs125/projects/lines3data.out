46: Suppose that a certain speedboat dealership sells ten

42: different models of speedboats and employs eight

43: salespersons. A record of sales for each month can be

47: represented by a two dimensional array in which each row

43: contains the number of sales of each model by a given

50: salesperson, and each column contains the number of sales of

45: each model.  The input file will always contain 10 rows and

45: 8 columns.  For example, suppose that the sales table for a

23: certain month is as follows:

48: Use lists (arrays) to solve this problem. The program should

40: be stored in speedboats.py.  You may run turnin for

46: speedboats as many times as you want (only the last one is

44: kept). This program is due at noon on Thursday, November 21,

24: 2013. This program is worth 90 points.
